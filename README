SOUP Streams Over Unsupported Protocols

SOUP is a small HTTP Streaming Service which proxies streams. Its intention is to proxy modern streaming technologies (HLS etc..) and transcode them to an MP3 stream, with the intention of serving that content to legacy devices on a LAN (eg old internet radios). Once deployed on a machine on the LAN, you call it thusly:

http://myserver:2010/?stream=http://www.somewhere.test/high-quality-stream-hls.m3u8

How it works:

Client opens http request
SOAP takes stream url as a parameter
Creates a fifo pipe
Mplayer plays url, streams wav output to fifo pipe
Pipe is transcoded to mp3 and returned as response stream

On client disconnect the mplayer process is killed and the pipe deleted.


Dependencies:

MPlayer
Python
